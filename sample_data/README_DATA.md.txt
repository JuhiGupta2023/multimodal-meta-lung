The original dataset is "Lung Nodule Dataset with Histopathology-based Cancer Type Annotation" by Jian et al., which provides computed tomography (CT) scans of biopsy-confirmed lung nodules together with histopathology-derived subtype labels. Each case includes paired 2D CT slices and a 3D volumetric CT cube centered on the annotated nodule. This dataset can be downloaded from the following GitHub repository:
